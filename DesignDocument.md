<h1> 1. Problem Statement</h1>
People have busy lives, and find it easy to lose track of the things they need to accomplish on a day-to-day basis. I want to solve this problem by developing a web-application that allows individuals to
create a task manager, add tasks, and set reminders - as well as collaborate with others who may partake in their daily schedule.

<h1> 2. Top Questions to Resolve </h1>
1. How will I store, query, and get tasks?

2. How will I keep track of time and reminders?

3. How can I allow other users to sign up for a reminder on a task that is not directly their own?

<h1> 3. Use Cases </h1>
<b>U1.</b> As someone who does spends a lot of time away from the computer, I would like to be able to plan out my tasks ahead of time to keep track of my day.

<b>U2.</b> As a busy individual who has scheduled my day with RemindMe, I want to be able to receive text message reminders whenever I have something coming up.

<b>U3.</b> As a working professional, I want to be able to invite my co-workers to participate in a to-do list so we can manage our workload for the day.

<b>U4.</b> As a team leader using RemindMe, I want my employees to receive SMS notifications when something important during the day is coming up.

<b>U5. </b> As a person with a busy schedule, I want to be able to set up recurring tasks, so that I can be reminded to do regular activities like taking medication, paying bills, and doing exercise.

<h1> 4. Scope </h1>
<h2> 4.1. In Scope</h2>

* A user can sign up for the application using a username, password, and phone number.

* User can create a task manager to store their daily tasks

* The creator of the task manager should be able to allow other users, upon invitation, to access the task manager.

* The creator should be able to add a task using a date for which the task is due.

* The daily tasks page, for sake of length, will only be able to hold 10 tasks per page.

* The all tasks page will only be able to hold 15 tasks per page.

* Creator and users should be able to select a RemindMe button for each task, giving them an SMS reminder shortly before the task is due.


<h2> 4.2. Out of Scope</h2>

* May want creators/users to customize the amount of texts/reminders they receive for each task

* May want creators/users to customize the exact time they receive a text/reminder per task

* May want creators to have the ability to prioritize certain tasks

* May want to allow for email reminders for tasks
