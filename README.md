# RemindMe

A full-stack web application built by me (Jake Price) for my capstone project at Nashville Software School.

Everyday life is busy. It's easy to lose track of what you need to accomplish throughout each and every day. RemindMe resolves that problem. RemindMe allows you to create a Task Manager for any specific category you may need, whether that be a grocery list, a gym workout plan, or a chore list for your children. 



## Tech Stack

**Client:** Java, JavaScript, CSS.

**AWS:** Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudFront, API Gateway, Cognito.
